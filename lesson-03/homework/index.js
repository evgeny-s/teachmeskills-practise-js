// Homework

//- Write the `init` function to set up an event listener on the form. The event listener should pass the value of the input element to the `check` function.
//- Write the `check` function to accept a value from the event listener and check it against the `targetNumber`.
//- If the values match, call the `showWin` function
//- If the values do not match, call the `showError` function.
//- If the values do not match, and the player has made more than five guesses, call the `showLoss` function.
//- Write the `showWin` function to remove the form and any error message, and show a message telling the player they win.
//- Write the `showError` function to show a message telling the player their guess is incorrect.
//- Write the `showLoss` function to remove the form and show a message telling the player they lose.
