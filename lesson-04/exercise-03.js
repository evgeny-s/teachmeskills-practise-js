// Exercise 03:
//Create an object called shape that has the type property and a getType() method.

//Define a Triangle() constructor function whose prototype is shape. Objects created with Triangle() should have three own propertiesâ€”a, b, and c, representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

//Add a new method to the prototype called getPerimeter()
